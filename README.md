## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore or modify this PCB design, you will need the KiCad EDA Suite.

### Prerequisites

*   **KiCad EDA Suite**: Version 7.0 or newer is recommended for full compatibility with the project files.
    *   [Download KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/64860/IOT-THING.git
    cd IOT-THING
    ```

### Opening the Project

1.  **Launch KiCad.**
2.  From the KiCad project manager, go to `File` > `Open Project...` and navigate to the cloned repository.
3.  Select the `IOT_thing.kicad_pro` file and click `Open`.

This will load the entire project, including the schematic (`.kicad_sch`) and PCB layout (`.kicad_pcb`).

### Generating Fabrication Files

Once you have opened the project in KiCad, you can generate manufacturing output files:

1.  **Generate Gerbers for PCB manufacturing:**
    *   Open the `IOT_thing.kicad_pcb` file.
    *   Go to `File` > `Fabrication Outputs` > `Gerber files...`
    *   Configure output settings as required by your PCB manufacturer and click `Plot`.
2.  **Generate Bill of Materials (BOM):**
    *   Open the `IOT_thing.kicad_sch` file.
    *   Go to `Tools` > `Generate Bill of Materials...`
    *   Select a BOM generator script (e.g., `bom_csv_grouped_by_value.py`) and click `Generate`.
3.  **Generate Pick and Place files:**
    *   Open the `IOT_thing.kicad_pcb` file.
    *   Go to `File` > `Fabrication Outputs` > `Footprint Position (.pos) files...`
    *   Configure settings for your assembly house and click `Generate File`.
